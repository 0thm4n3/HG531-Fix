# Huawui Router HG531 Fix | TEDATA Issue

### Info

Router name : HUAWEI 300Mbps Wireless ADSL2+ Router || 
Model: HG531 V1 ||
Firmware version : V100R001C01B019 

### Issue

If you live in Egypt so it will be your issue and you will need to fix it. Te-data are giving all new comers a new router with your monthly subscription as a free device because you bought this service from them.

Also this issue exists with all communicatuions corps that offers routers or if you buy a router such from ISPs like vodafone, orange, etc. This issue will exists in all routers like these.

While am digging in this new device i found the following things :

1. Some features in the router are not enabled as you are not the full controller of your device.
2. 2 Access points were added and pre configured in your device , one is open and the other is protected with password , these access point has SSIDs like: te wifi & te wifi EAP and i could not able to remove these access point or edit on them.

### Fix

Fixing this issue is easy , i searched and i found a firmware of this router with the same model and simply you can go to the page of the upgrading the firmware and upgrade it : 
Maintenance > Device > Firmware Upgrade

After upgrading your firmware everything will be as you left it but everything will be unlocked and the router will be totally yours. Nothing will change and if anything changed i offered a new password for the admin that may be change to in the downloadable file.
